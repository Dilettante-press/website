## Welcome to The Dilettante

The dilettante post is a periodic summary of an article of scholarly interest that first appeared in a popular publication. These journalistic gems tend to explore territory that is claimed by multiple academic disciplines. They deftly walk the line between cogency and general-audience accessibility and provide valuable insights into the process and philosophical underpinnings of scholarly inquiry. We put these articles back in circulation in the hope that readers may convert such insights into practical decision-making skills. We also hope that they may provide a clearer lens through which to filter the constant stream of media content.

### A History of Violence

Multi-disciplinary scientist and ‘big-picture’ virtuoso **Jared Diamond** offers some reflections on retributive violence in an essay titled [‘Vengeance Is Ours’](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/21/vengeance-is-ours), published in **The New Yorker** on 21 April 2008. At the core of the study is an episode in a bloody, protracted war between two Highland clans in Papúa New Guinea, the Handas and the Ombals. So drawn-out was the conflict in question that by the time one of the protagonists, Daniel Wemp, was relating the events to Diamond, the cause of it all had been obscured; Wemp assumed that the initial spark was a dispute over a pig. Battlefield tactics, psychological warfare, fluid alliances, game-theoretical quandaries, all lend a simmering intensity to the narrative. A broad ethnographic sketch, which includes an examination of the ways in which violence is woven into the fabric of Highland society, provides context. Peppered throughout the text are comparisons between the cultural-institutional frameworks of tribal and mass societies, with special attention paid to the conventions related to governance. Diamond highlights the role played by state government in helping humanity break the vicious cycle of zero-sum tribal opposition. The state accomplishes this by being the agent to which dispute resolution and punishment for crimes are outsourced — and, a corollary, the holder of a monopoly on legitimate violence. The social peace achieved through such institutional arrangements, however, comes at a great human cost. This point is poignantly illustrated by the experiences of one of Diamond’s own family members during the Second World War.
