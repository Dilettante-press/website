title: The Dilettante
description: The dilettante post is a periodic summary of an article of scholarly interest that first appeared in a popular publication. These journalistic gems tend to explore territory that is claimed by multiple academic disciplines. They deftly walk the line between cogency and general-audience accessibility and provide valuable insights into the process and philosophical underpinnings of scholarly inquiry. We put these articles back in circulation in the hope that readers may convert such insights into practical decision-making skills. We also hope that they may provide a clearer lens through which to filter the constant stream of media content.
